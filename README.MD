Array Manipulation Tasks

This repository contains three tasks that demonstrate array manipulation techniques in JavaScript.

Task 1: Process Array

The first task involves processing an array of numbers by squaring even numbers and tripling odd numbers. The processArray function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array with the processed numbers.

Task 2: Format Array Strings

The second task involves formatting an array of strings based on an array of numbers processed by the processArray function. The formatArrayStrings function takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers. It returns a new array with the formatted strings, where each string is capitalized if its corresponding number is even and converted to lowercase if its corresponding number is odd.

Task 3: Create User Profiles

The third task involves creating an array of user profile objects based on an array of names and an array of modified names. The createUserProfiles function takes two arrays as input: an array of names and an array of modified names. It returns an array of user profile objects, each containing the original name, the modified name, and an auto-incremented id.
